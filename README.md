# `cadence`

A Python package providing efficient and robust implementations of fundamental advanced data structures.

---

## 📚 Description

`cadence` is designed to be a comprehensive library for more complex data organization principles beyond Python's built-in types. Inspired by the rhythm and flow of well-structured data, `cadence` offers optimized implementations of common non-linear and dynamic data structures, making it easier to tackle algorithmic challenges and build sophisticated applications.

## ✨ Implemented Data Structures

`cadence` currently includes implementations for:

- **Linked Lists**:
  - Singly Linked List

<!-- - **Linked Lists**:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Trees**:
  - Binary Tree (Binary Search Tree)
  - AVL Tree (Self-balancing Binary Search Tree)
  - Red-Black Tree (Self-balancing Binary Search Tree)
  - Trie (Prefix Tree)
- **Heaps**:
  - Min-Heap
  - Max-Heap
- **Graphs**:
  - Adjacency List representation
  - Basic graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) -->

_(More data structures and algorithms are planned for future releases!)_
